# U-Net Image Segmentation Model

This project implements and trains a U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net model is designed to efficiently perform segmentation by extracting and localizing relevant features from images. This README covers the project setup, methodology, and usage instructions for training the model.

## Introduction
The U-Net model is a fully convolutional neural network, originally designed for biomedical image segmentation. It is a symmetric network with an encoder-decoder structure that works well for image segmentation tasks with minimal data. This project uses PyTorch to implement U-Net, and it includes a custom training loop for segmenting images, especially in scenarios like detecting cracks in images.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: A robust encoder-decoder architecture for accurate image segmentation.
- **Pixel-wise Operations**: Extract and process individual pixel values in multi-dimensional arrays for specific use cases like crack detection in images.
- **RGB Image Processing**: Supports handling RGB images (256x256x3) while processing segmentation masks (256x256) to modify specific areas.
- **Median-Based Pixel Value Replacement**: Replaces white pixels on the segmentation mask with background-like pixel values from the original image.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unet-image-segmentation.git
   cd unet-image-segmentation
   
## Usage
To train the U-Net model and use it for image segmentation, follow these steps:

Run the train.py script to start training:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Replace the dataset loading logic in train.py with your own dataset of images and masks.

To perform crack detection and remove white pixels from the segmentation masks, modify the script to follow these pixel-wise operations:

Find White Pixels: Use nested loops to locate white pixels in the segmentation mask.
Modify Corresponding Pixels in the Original Image: Replace these pixel values in the original image with a calculated background-like value (e.g., median of surrounding pixel values).
Ensure your images are loaded as arrays using OpenCV or similar libraries:

python
Copy code
img = cv2.imread('path_to_image')  # Loads an image as a numpy array

## Methodology
1. Dataset Preparation
The project uses a custom dataset class to load and preprocess images and segmentation masks. The input images are assumed to be in RGB format (256x256x3), while the masks are grayscale (256x256).
2. U-Net Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder (contracting path) to capture the context and a decoder (expanding path) to enable precise localization. The architecture is symmetric, making it highly efficient for image segmentation tasks.
3. Training Process
The U-Net model is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function (for binary segmentation tasks) and the Adam optimizer. The loss is minimized by iterating through batches of images and segmentation masks, updating the model's weights to improve segmentation accuracy.
4. Pixel Operations for Crack Detection
Segmentation Mask Processing: The project identifies white pixels in the segmentation mask and replaces the corresponding pixels in the original image with median pixel values from neighboring areas. This effectively removes visual cracks from the original image, giving it a more uniform look.
5. Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient to measure segmentation accuracy. These metrics provide insight into how well the model segments the desired regions in the images.
6. Model Saving
The trained model is saved to disk using PyTorch's torch.save() method, allowing future use for inference or fine-tuning.

## Results
The U-Net model performs well on image segmentation tasks, specifically in detecting and repairing cracks in images. During training, the loss decreases consistently, indicating the model's ability to generalize across the dataset. The pixel-wise operation method effectively modifies images by removing cracks and smoothing out regions.
